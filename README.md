# What Is This?

It's a collection of Python scripts to do* with [dooit](https://github.com/dooit-org/dooit)!

\* get it?

This repository is mainly a way for me to practice Python after an introductory college course.
Since I actually use dooit and really enjoy it, it provides me great motivation.
